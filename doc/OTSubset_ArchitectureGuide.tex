\paragraph{SubsetSampling}

The class SubsetSampling derives from the Simulation class and implements the subset simulation algorithm.\\

\paragraph{SubsetSamplingResult}

The class SubsetSamplingResult derives from SimulationResultImplementation.\\
It allows to store the number of subset steps and return the subset-specific coefficient of variation.\\
