\section{Use Cases Guide}

This section presents the main functionalities of the module $subset$ in their context.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Which python modules to import ?}

In order to use the functionalities described in this documentation, it is necessary to import  : 
\begin{itemize}
   \item the $otsubset$ module.
\end{itemize}

Python  script for this use case :
\begin{lstlisting}
from otsubset import *
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Create a subset simulation algorithm}

Details on the SubsetSampling object can be found in the UserManual at the next chapter.\\

Details on simulation algorithms can be found in the Reference Guide (\href{OpenTURNS_ReferenceGuide.pdf}{see files Reference Guide - Step C -- Estimating the probability of an event using Sampling} and files around).\\


\requirements{
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] the event we want to evaluate the probability : {\itshape myEvent}
  \item[type:] Event
  \item[$\bullet$] the target conditional probability of each subset domain
  \item[type:] NumericalScalar
  \item[$\bullet$] the width of the MCMC random walk uniform distribution
  \item[type:] NumericalScalar
  \item[$\bullet$] the number of samples per step
  \item[type:] UnsignedLong
  \end{description}
}
{
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\bullet$] the SubsetSampling simulation algorithm : {\itshape mySSAlgo}
  \item[type:] Simulation
  \item[$\bullet$] the SubsetSampling simulation result : {\itshape myResult}
  \item[type:] SimulationResult
  \end{description}
}

\newpage
Python  script for this UseCase :

\begin{lstlisting}
  # Create a Subset Sampling algorithm
  mySSAlgo = SubsetSampling(myEvent)

  # Change the target conditional probability of each subset domain
  # mySSAlgo.setTargetProbability(0.9)

  # Set the width of the MCMC random walk uniform distribution
  mySSAlgo.setProposalRange(1.8)

  # This allows to control the number of samples per step
  mySSAlgo.setMaximumOuterSampling(10000)

  # Run the algorithm
  mySSAlgo.run()

  # Retrieve the result
  myResult = mySSAlgo.getResult()
  
  # Extract some results
  print 'Pf:', myResult.getEventProbability()
  print 'Cov:', myResult.getCoefficientOfVariation()
  print 'Number of steps:', myResult.getNumberOfSteps()
\end{lstlisting}
